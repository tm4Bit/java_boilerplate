# Java Kickstart Template

Welcome! This repository provides a minimal, ready-to-use skeleton for a Java project. It's designed for developers who want to quickly start coding without the overhead of a large build system, using simple shell scripts to compile and run the application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or later.
- **Git**: For version control and cloning the project.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To create a new project from this template, simply run the following command in your terminal. It will download and execute the installation script, which sets up a clean project for you.

```sh
curl -sSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tm4Bit/java_boilerplate/master/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tm4Bit/java_boilerplate/master/install.sh) | bash
```

The installer will:

1.  Ask for your desired project name.
2.  Clone this template repository.
3.  Remove the template's Git history (`.git` folder).
4.  Initialize a fresh `git` repository for your new project.
5.  Provide you with the next steps to run your application.

> **Note**: If you're using a Java Language Server like `jdtls` in an editor like Neovim, the installer automatically initializes a Git repository to ensure the language server attaches to the buffer correctly.

## How to Run the Application

Once the project is created, navigate into your project's directory and use the `run.sh` script to compile and execute your code.

```sh
# Navigate into your new project directory
cd your-project-name

# Make the run script executable (only needs to be done once)
chmod +x run.sh

# Compile and run your application
./run.sh
```

## Folder Structure

The project uses a standard, lightweight directory structure.

- `src/`: Contains your Java source code (`.java` files). By convention, it's recommended to place your code in `src/main/java`.
- `bin/`: The output directory for compiled Java classes (`.class` files). This folder is automatically generated by the `run.sh` script and is listed in the `.gitignore` file.
- `lib/`: A place to store third-party libraries (`.jar` files) if you choose to manage them manually.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `run.sh` script is configurable via variables at the top of the file. If you change your project's main entry point, you will need to update it.

**To change the main class:**

1.  Open the `run.sh` file.
2.  Modify the `MAIN_CLASS` variable to match your new main class's fully qualified name.

```sh
# file: run.sh

# ...
# Main class to be executed, which contains the main() method.
MAIN_CLASS="main.java.application.Main" # <-- Change this value
# ...
```

## Class Design Templates

Here are some basic templates you can follow for organizing your classes.

#### Entity Class

| Class              |
| ------------------ |
| ‚Äî property: type   |
| + method(): return |

#### Service Class

| Class              |
| ------------------ |
| ‚Äî property: type   |
| + method(): return |
